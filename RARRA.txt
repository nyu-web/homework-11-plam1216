I think the AARRR and RARRA frameworks are both great frameworks to follow, but I would 
prefer following the RARRA model. I have a friend who develops mobile games for fun, but 
was trying to turn it into a career. One of his games got featured on MASHABLE's SnapChat 
and got a huge spike in downloads, but the retention rate for users was very low because 
there weren't many features to the game that would keep them coming back to play, so although
he did receive a huge spike in downloads, the amount of users who continued to play his game
after a month was very low. Something that I think people should also understand while following
these frameworks is that the payoff also doesn't always necessarily have to be monetary. If you
are thinking long-term, it could be about the mystery of new producers that drives users to consistently 
check on your site.
